# EPL_Match_Predictor
This project predicts English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes using a Random Forest model. It gathers historical match data (2017-18 to 2022-23 season) from fbref.com through web scraping, utilizing BeautifulSoup and the requests library to extract match stats and player metrics like shooting stats and prepare the necessary features. I have trained the model using data from 17-18 to the 21-22 season (5 Seasons) and I have split the 22-23 season data into the test and validation set.
# Results

The Precision of the Model is 0.807
